      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-10">Last updated: June 2026</p>

      <p className="mb-6">This Privacy Policy describes how Industry Forms Limited ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application and SaaS platform (collectively, the "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the Australian Privacy Act 1988.</p>
      <p className="mb-10">By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.1 Account Information</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">When you register for an account, we collect your full name, email address, password (stored in encrypted form), and business or organisation name (if applicable).</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.2 Payment Information</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">To process subscription payments, we collect billing details including credit or debit card details (processed and stored by our payment provider — we do not store full card numbers on our servers), billing address, and transaction history. Payments are processed by a PCI DSS-compliant third-party payment processor.</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.3 Customer Data</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">As part of using our productivity tools, you may input or upload business data, documents, contacts, or other customer information ("Customer Data"). We process this data solely to provide the Service to you.</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.4 Location Data</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">With your permission, the mobile app collects precise GPS location data to provide the automated vehicle travel logbook feature (recording trip start/end points and distance). Location data is associated with your account and is accessible to your company's administrators. You can disable location access at any time through your device settings, which will disable the auto-track feature.</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.5 Usage and Technical Data</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect certain technical data including device type, operating system, app version, IP address, log data (pages visited, features used, timestamps), and crash reports.</p>
