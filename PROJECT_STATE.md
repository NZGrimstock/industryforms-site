# IndustryForms — Project State (handoff)

Last updated: 2026-07-06. Catch-up doc for a fresh session. Read this first.

## What it is
**IndustryForms** — a SaaS job-management app for NZ/AU tradespeople (a Tradify
competitor). Monorepo at `D:\TRADIEE`:
- `tradiee-app/` — **Next.js 16** web app (App Router, Turbopack)
- `tradiee-mobile/` — **Expo SDK 56** mobile app (bare workflow, native `android/` dir)
- `supabase/migrations/` — database migrations (001–046)
- Root docs: this file, `POWERSYNC_SETUP.md`, `R2_SETUP.md`, `SUPABASE_CLOUD_MIGRATION.md`, `VERCEL_DEPLOY.md`, `sync-rules.yaml`

GitHub: **https://github.com/NZGrimstock/industryforms** (branch `main`, auto-deploys to Vercel).

### Where work lives right now
**`main` is current** — Growth Engine Sprints A through E all merged
(A/B/C/D on 2026-07-03/04, E on 2026-07-06), executing
`SPRINTS_GROWTH_ENGINE_RESCOPED.md` in full (see that file +
`SPRINT_A_INBOX_EXECUTION.md` for the original sprint plan). **The Growth
Engine roadmap is now complete** — no more sprints scoped in that doc.
Migrations use timestamped filenames (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`), not
the old `0XX_` numbering — latest is `20260704090000_automation_events.sql`,
applied to cloud Supabase. PowerSync sync rules switched to **streams
(edition 3)** — already validated + deployed via the PowerSync Dashboard.
Latest APK is `tradiee-mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
(Jun 25, 145 MB — mobile untouched by the Growth Engine sprints).

**Sprint E (automations + growth reporting) shipped 2026-07-06.** New
`automation_events` table (migration `20260704090000_automation_events.sql`)
logs every automated send — `channel` (email/sms), `status`
(pending/sent/skipped_sms_dark/failed), `error`. `lib/notify.ts` is the
channel-aware helper: `notify()` fires every channel that has a recipient
(used for confirmations/reminders — belt-and-suspenders is fine there);
`notifyPreferred()` sends exactly one message, preferring SMS when Twilio's
live and the customer has a phone (used for review requests, so going live
with Twilio doesn't suddenly double-send). SMS always logs
`skipped_sms_dark` instead of vanishing when Twilio isn't configured — flips
to actually sending with zero code changes once it is. **Not manually
verified against live Twilio** — credentials are live in this env, so
SMS-path testing was deliberately skipped to avoid sending real texts to a
real number during dev; the code path is exercised (build+lint clean, dark
path exercised naturally since Twilio wasn't invoked with sms recipients in
testing) but not this specific fork of the notify() logic. Verify manually
before relying on it in production.

Automations wired in (all routed through `notify()`/`notifyPreferred()`,
all logged to `automation_events`):
- **Booking confirmed** (`lib/bookings/notify.ts sendBookingConfirmationEmail`) —
  called from `api/bookings/create` (no-deposit auto-confirm), the Stripe
  webhook (deposit paid), and the admin confirm action. Respects
  `booking_settings.confirmation_channel` (email/sms/both) for whether SMS is
  attempted at all.
- **Booking requested** (`sendBookingRequestedEmail`) — new acknowledgement
  email sent when a booking lands in `requested` (manual-approval packages);
  this didn't exist before Sprint E — visitors got silence until an admin
  manually confirmed.
- **24h booking reminder** — extended `api/reminders` (existing appointment-
  reminder cron section). Booking-sourced visits now get email too (was
  SMS-only before, and only SMS at that — a real pre-existing gap since email
  is the only channel actually live). Dedup via `automation_events`, not
  `job_visits.reminder_sent_at` (that column still belongs to the plain,
  non-booking visit loop, untouched).
- **Post-completion invoice** — new `api/reminders` section: when a
  booking's package has `creates_invoice=true` and its linked job's status is
  literally `'completed'` (scope note: checks the seeded default key, not each
  company's custom `job_statuses` — see code comment), creates a draft
  invoice at the package price and emails it, linking `bookings.invoice_id`.
- **Win-back** — new `api/reminders` section: completed jobs whose package
  has `recurring_interval_months` queue a re-book email (+ dark SMS) once
  that interval has elapsed since the visit's `actual_end`/`scheduled_end`.
  Link is `{appUrl}/site/{slug}/book/{packageId}` when the company has a
  website, else just `{appUrl}`.
- **Review request** — `lib/review-request.ts` refactored to route through
  `notifyPreferred()` instead of raw `sendEmail()` — same invoice-paid
  trigger as before (Stripe webhook + manual "Record payment"), now also
  tries SMS first when live, and links back to the originating booking (if
  any) via a `bookings.invoice_id` lookup for `automation_events`.

**Reporting**: `/reports` gained a **Growth** section (gated on
`hasAddon('bookings_website')`) — booking conversion rate, deposit revenue,
review requests sent, repeat-customer revenue, leads by source, bookings by
package, and an **Automation activity** card (sent / dark / failed counts +
the 5 most recent failures with their error text) satisfying "failed/skipped
sends visible to admin". **Not built**: avg inbound response time — nothing
in the schema records when a lead first got a reply, so there's no data to
report on; would need a new timestamp captured at first-response time, out of
scope for this sprint.

**Two real bugs caught and fixed during Sprint E build/testing** (both
pre-existing, found because Sprint E's post-completion invoicing exercised
draft-invoice creation for the first time in an automated context):
1. `companies.gst_rate` doesn't exist — the real column is
   `companies.default_gst_rate`. Both `app/api/reminders/route.ts` (new, this
   sprint) and the **pre-existing** `app/api/invoices/route.ts` (mobile
   "Complete and Invoice" flow) had this typo; both silently fell back to the
   0.15 default via `?? 0.15` instead of erroring, so a company with a custom
   GST rate got the wrong tax on every job→invoice conversion — a real,
   silent, live bug, now fixed in both places.
2. Companies with no custom `job_statuses` rows (i.e. **every company created
   after** migration 037's one-time backfill — new signups never get seeded)
   have zero terminal-status rows in the DB, so a naive `is_terminal=true`
   lookup finds nothing and every "is this job done" check silently fails for
   any new company. Fixed by falling back to `DEFAULT_JOB_STATUSES` from
   `lib/job-statuses.ts` (the same fallback every other reader in the app
   already uses) when a company has no custom rows — win-back would otherwise
   never fire for the majority of real companies.

**Sprint D (public booking widget + Stripe deposits) shipped 2026-07-04.**
Public widget at `app/site/[slug]/book/[packageId]/page.tsx` +
`booking-widget.tsx` (uses the package **id** in the URL, not a slug —
`bookable_packages.public_slug` exists in the schema but there's no admin UI
to set one yet, so id-in-URL is the pragmatic choice; revisit if pretty URLs
matter later). Flow: pick slot → `POST /api/bookings/hold` (wraps
`tryHoldSlot()`) → enter details → `POST /api/bookings/create` (matches
customer by normalized email then phone, conflicting matches flag the
booking for review, transitions status per package rules) → if
`requires_deposit`, `POST /api/bookings/deposit-intent` creates a Stripe
PaymentIntent and mounts Stripe Elements inline. `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
has a new `payment_intent.succeeded` branch (`handleBookingDepositPaid`) that
sets `deposit_paid`, flips status to `confirmed`, creates the job/visit, and
emails confirmation — guarded by `.eq('status', 'deposit_pending')` so a
Stripe retry is a no-op (verified by replaying the same event: no double
deposit, no duplicate job). Job/visit creation is shared via
`lib/bookings/fulfill.ts createJobFromBooking()` across three callers: the
create route (no-deposit auto-confirm), the webhook (deposit paid), and the
new admin confirm action. Booking confirmation email lives in
`lib/email.ts bookingConfirmationEmailHtml()` + `lib/bookings/notify.ts`.

Admin surface: `/bookings` gained a **Requests** tab (new default tab) listing
actual `bookings` rows with Confirm/No-show/Cancel actions
(`PATCH /api/bookings/[id]`) and a deposit **Refund** button
(`POST /api/bookings/refund`) enforcing the refund policy below — disabled
client-side and rejected server-side outside the window, with a tooltip
explaining why. Packages tab got a "Copy link" button (needs
`company_websites.slug` — falls back to nothing if the company has no
website row yet). **Bug caught during manual testing, fixed before commit**:
the confirm/cancel/no-show route wrote `status: action` directly, so
"cancel" (the action name) got written instead of "cancelled" (the enum
value) — violated `bookings_status_chk` silently because the Supabase error
wasn't checked. Fixed by mapping action → status explicitly and checking
`error` on every write in that route.

> **Deposit refund policy (decided 2026-07-04): full refund if the booking is
> cancelled more than 24 hours before `starts_at`; deposit is forfeited for a
> late cancellation or no-show.** Hardcoded 24h window constant in both
> `app/api/bookings/refund/route.ts` and the admin UI's button-disable check
> (per-company configurability wasn't asked for). Admin triggers the refund
> manually via a button that's only enabled outside the forfeit window — no
> auto-refund on cancellation, per the doc.

Manually verified end-to-end against cloud Supabase + live Stripe test mode
(not just `tsc`/`next build`): no-deposit auto-confirm path (slot hold →
customer+job+visit created correctly), deposit path (real PaymentIntent
created, `stripe_payment_intent_id` stored pre-payment, webhook signed and
replayed via `stripe.webhooks.generateTestHeaderString` — confirmed
idempotent), and the admin Requests tab end to end including the refund
policy rejection. Test data cleaned up after.

**Correction to a long-standing assumption**: Twilio and Stripe are **both
already live** (real credentials in `.env.local`/Vercel), not dark/pending as
older docs (including early Growth Engine planning) assumed. Signature
verification on `/api/sms/inbound` was missing until Sprint A — a real gap
against live traffic, not just go-live prep.

## Live infrastructure (all provisioned)
| Piece | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Supabase** | Cloud project ref `cfltbpwrojtlpkjvresd` (Sydney/SEA). **New API keys**: publishable (client) + secret (server) — NOT legacy anon/service_role. Migrations 001–046 all applied to cloud. |
| **Web hosting** | **Vercel**, custom domain **app.industryforms.app**. Vercel **Root Directory = `tradiee-app`**, **Framework Preset = Next.js**. `tradiee-app/vercel.json` defines two daily crons (`/api/reminders` 20:00 UTC, `/api/daily-todos` 18:00 UTC = 6am NZ). |
| **Storage** | **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible). Buckets: `industry-forms-public` (logos, job photos, customer sign-offs — via **cdn.industryforms.app**) and `industry-forms` (private compliance PDFs via presigned URLs). |
| **Offline sync** | **PowerSync** `https://6a33b406deeddd0df605d498.powersync.journeyapps.com`, connected to cloud DB, JWKS auth via Supabase. `sync-rules.yaml` is now **edition-3 sync streams** (deployed). |
| **SMS** | **Twilio** — credentials live (configured by user 2026-06-22). Inbound webhook → `/api/sms/inbound`. |
| **Mobile** | Expo `@grimstock/industryforms` (EAS, logged in as `grimstock`). APK builds via **local Gradle**: `cd tradiee-mobile/android && gradlew.bat assembleRelease --no-daemon`. EAS free plan resets **2026-07-01** — use EAS for future cloud builds then, or use local Gradle on Windows. Don't run release builds back-to-back — flaky `packageRelease` lock errors; if it fails run `gradlew.bat clean assembleRelease`. |

## Env vars (NEVER commit real secret values)
**Set in Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables** (Production +
Preview), then redeploy. Mirror non-secret ones in `tradiee-app/.env.local`
for local dev. Settings → Integrations now shows a green-tick / amber-warning
on each of these so the owner sees what's missing without peeking at env vars.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_PUBLIC_BUCKET`, `R2_PRIVATE_BUCKET`, `R2_PUBLIC_*`/`R2_PRIVATE_*` keys, `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cdn.industryforms.app`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.industryforms.app`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POWERSYNC_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`
- **LocationIQ** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCATIONIQ_KEY` for geocoding (address autocomplete + job map pins). Falls back to Nominatim (rate-limited in prod) if unset.
- **Twilio (live)** — `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`. Point the number's "A MESSAGE COMES IN" webhook at `https://app.industryforms.app/api/sms/inbound` (POST).
- **Resend (pending)** — `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` (verified sender domain).
- **Stripe (pending)** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Webhook target: `/api/stripe/webhook`. Needed for online invoice payments, plan upgrades, and Tap to Pay.
- **Anthropic (live)** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for SmartWrite / AI quote drafting / daily AI to-dos.
- **Other placeholders** — `XERO_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` (real value present), `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`+`CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` (+optional `CLOUDFLARE_SAAS_FALLBACK_HOSTNAME`), `INBOUND_EMAIL_SECRET`.

Mobile `tradiee-mobile/.env` + `eas.json` carry `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` equivalents (client-public, baked into builds).

## Features built

### Core workflow
**Enquiries** (+convert, dup-detection; sources incl. website, email inbox,
booking widget; **AI-draft-quote** from the convert dialog grounds line items
in the price list) → **Quotes** (builder with sections, price-list, kits,
optional sections + online accept/decline, per-line + document **discounts**,
per-line **tax**, **gross-profit** display, **save-as-template** /
new-from-template, public `/q/[token]`, email/SMS) → **Jobs** (list/board/map,
detail, **custom statuses**, assign to team member, **per-job tasks**,
recurring) → **Scheduling** (visits, Google Calendar sync) → **Invoicing**
(full/progress/actuals, line items + discounts + per-line tax + tax-inclusive
mode, payments incl. **Stripe**, **Xero** sync, recurring invoices, bulk
invoicing, email/SMS, public `/i/[token]`) → **Payments** → **Review request
email** auto-sent after paid.

### Growth Engine Sprint C (2026-07-04) — bookable packages + availability engine

Schema: `bookable_packages`, `booking_settings`, `booking_availability_rules`,
`booking_blackouts`, and (brought forward from Sprint D — the concurrency
guarantee can't be tested without it) `bookings` with only its hold-related
columns exercised. Concurrency guard is a **partial unique index** on
`(company_id, coalesce(assigned_to, sentinel), starts_at)` for live statuses
— the insert IS the mutex. **Caught before shipping**: Postgres unique
indexes treat `NULL <> NULL`, so the first version of that index silently
didn't protect "any staff" bookings (`assigned_to null`, the common case) at
all — fixed with the `coalesce` expression, verified by firing 5 truly
concurrent inserts at the same slot: exactly 1 succeeded, 4 got `23505`.

`lib/bookings/timezone.ts` — DST-safe wall-clock↔UTC conversion via
`Intl.DateTimeFormat` only, no new dependency. `lib/bookings/availability.ts`
generates slots from hours + blackouts + `job_visits` + live bookings,
respecting per-package buffers; resolves against one staff context at a time
(specific `profileId`, or company-wide when none given) — documented scope
reduction, not a correctness shortcut. `tryHoldSlot()` reaps an expired hold
on the exact slot inline on retry; new hourly `/api/bookings/reap-holds` cron
handles broader cleanup. Admin UI at `/bookings` (packages, weekly hours,
blackouts), gated on `bookings_website` like the rest of Sprint B.

### Growth Engine Sprint A + B (2026-07-03/04) — unified inbox + bookings website add-on

Executing `SPRINTS_GROWTH_ENGINE_RESCOPED.md`. Full detail in commit messages
(`git log`); summary below. **Reality check that changed scope**: Twilio and
Stripe are both already live — this wasn't prep-for-future-go-live, it closed
active gaps against real traffic.

**Sprint A — `/messages` unified inbox**
New owner/admin page merging `customer_messages` (SMS, grouped by customer)
and `enquiries` (web leads) into one feed with tabs (Open/Unread/Bookings/
Enquiries/Unmatched/Closed), normalized in `lib/messages.ts` and shared
between the SSR page and a 15s-polled `/api/messages/conversations`. Triage
actions in `/api/messages/action` (mark read/closed/spam, create-customer-
from-unmatched with thread re-homing). `components/customers/sms-thread.tsx`
(pre-existing, already used on `/customers/[id]`) extended with a
`twilioLive` prop for a dark-aware disabled reply box.
Real fixes along the way: `/api/sms/inbound` had **no signature
verification** despite live Twilio credentials (added HMAC-SHA1 check in
`lib/sms.ts`, no new dependency — 503 dark/unset, 403 invalid signature); it
was also **silently dropping unmatched inbound** (comment claimed otherwise,
code didn't) — now persists with `customer_id null` so it surfaces in the
Unmatched tab. Added `TWILIO_OWNER_COMPANY_ID` env var for unmatched-sender
company resolution (**add this to Vercel** — local-only in `.env.local` right
now, no per-company Twilio number mapping exists yet). Also fixed
`enquiry_source` enum missing `'booking'` — `/api/site/lead` had been
inserting an invalid value for every booking-kind lead since the
`BookingForm` component was added (found while normalizing enquiry sources
for the inbox feed).

**Sprint B — Bookings Website add-on ($19/mo)**
Found two parallel gating mechanisms for what should've been one add-on:
`companies.addons.website` (JSONB, unused for gating) and
`company_websites.subscription_active` (the real one, driven by a live
Stripe webhook). Consolidated onto `hasAddon('bookings_website')` for both
site-publish and custom-domain gates; migration backfills existing
subscribers so nobody loses access. Added a **bookings on/off toggle**
(independent of publishing) and exposed the `'booking'` website-section type
in the builder — it existed in the type system and render path but had no
UI to add one. Added **custom static-site hosting**: single-HTML-file
upload (zip support deliberately deferred — needs its own zip-slip/zip-bomb
security pass), served via `proxy.ts`'s native external-URL middleware
rewrite (true edge reverse-proxy, visitor's address bar stays on their
domain). Verified cookie isolation before shipping (no wildcard cookie
domain anywhere — Supabase auth cookies are host-only scoped to
`app.industryforms.app`), added CSP on served custom content, and — since it
was missing entirely — added global `X-Frame-Options`/`frame-ancestors` on
the main app in `next.config.ts` (any page including `/login` could
previously be framed by any third-party site). Super-admin takedown control
lives on a new `/admin/companies/[id]` detail page — the companies list had
been linking to that route already, 404ing, since no detail page existed.

Sprint E (automations + reporting) shipped 2026-07-06 — see the summary near
the top of this doc under "Where work lives right now".

### Sprint 6 (2026-07-03) — mobile nav/quote fixes + kits + signup, all on `main`

**Mobile: fixed quote creation crash**
`tradiee-mobile/app/quotes/new.tsx` inserted quotes without `quote_number`,
violating the not-null constraint. Now generates the number the same way the
web app does (`companies.quote_prefix` + running count). Also added an
**expiry-days picker** (7/14/30/60, was hardcoded to 30 with no UI) and a
**job site selector** (populated from the chosen customer's `customer_sites`,
writes `quotes.site_id`) — both were previously missing from the mobile form.

**Mobile: mandatory customer fields on quick-add**
The inline "new customer" mini-forms in `tradiee-mobile/app/jobs/new.tsx` and
`tradiee-mobile/app/quotes/new.tsx` now require name, email, phone, and
billing address (jobs' quick-add previously only collected name+phone). A
`customer_sites` row is auto-created from the billing address, same as the
web customer form.

**Web: mandatory customer fields**
`tradiee-app/components/forms/customer-form.tsx` — email, phone, and billing
address are now required (previously only name was required).

**Mobile: navigation fix for More-tab screens**
Customers, Invoices, Time Logs, Job Map, and Invitations were registered as
*hidden tabs* inside the `(tabs)` navigator (`href: null`), so opening them
from the More menu did a tab-switch rather than a stack push — Android back
button jumped to Home instead of returning to More. Moved all five out of
`(tabs)/` into top-level stack routes (`app/customers/index.tsx`,
`app/invoices/index.tsx`, `app/timesheets.tsx`, `app/job-map.tsx`,
`app/invitations.tsx`), registered with native headers in root
`app/_layout.tsx`. Back button now works correctly. Also fixed
`invitations.tsx`'s hardcoded `paddingTop: 56` (no `SafeAreaView`) — now uses
`SafeAreaView` like every other screen.

**Mobile: increased top padding**
Bumped `paddingTop` from 8→20 on the header row of `jobs.tsx`, `quotes.tsx`,
`schedule.tsx`, and added explicit top padding to `home.tsx` and `more.tsx`
(both lacked any — content sat flush against the safe-area edge since the
header bars were removed in a prior sprint).

**Web: kits in job materials & invoice line items**
Kits (bundles of price-list items) were quote-only. Added the same "From
kit" picker to `tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/jobs/[id]/materials.tsx` (job
materials) and the invoice "Add line item" dialog in
`tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/invoices/[id]/client.tsx`, alongside a
price-list search that pre-fills the manual line form.

**Web: signup — new trade options + profession tracking**
Added "Automotive" and "Engineer" to the trade/industry dropdown in
`tradiee-app/app/signup/page.tsx` (also now validated as required client-side,
previously bypassable). `trade_type` is logged server-side on signup
(`app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`) and now shown as a "Trade" column on
`/admin/companies`.

### Sprint 5 (2026-06-25) — mobile completeness + web parity, all on `main`

**Mobile: New job — inline new customer**
`tradiee-mobile/app/jobs/new.tsx`: "New customer" button in the customer picker
FlatList header. Switches to an inline form (name, phone); taps "Create &
select" → `POST /api/customers` → auto-selects. "← Back" returns to customer
list. Job creation now goes through `/api/jobs` (was a direct Supabase insert)
so `nextDocNumber()` runs server-side — fixes null `job_number` on mobile.

**Mobile: Photo prompt before sign-off/invoice**
`tradiee-mobile/app/jobs/[id].tsx`: `promptCompleteWithSignoff()` and
`promptCompleteAndInvoice()` check if the job has any photos. If none, fires an
Alert: "Add photos" (opens camera), "Skip & continue", "Cancel". Existing
"Complete & get sign-off" and "Complete & Invoice" buttons now call these wrappers.

**Mobile: "Customer Signature" label in sign-off modal**
Same file: label rendered above the WebView signature pad — uppercase, letter-spaced,
styled to match the section headers.

**Mobile: Auto-track trading hours schedule**
`tradiee-mobile/app/(tabs)/timesheets.tsx`: configurable start/end hour + active
days. Persisted in `AsyncStorage` under key `TRADIEE_TRADING_HOURS`. `useFocusEffect`
reads the schedule and auto-starts/stops GPS tracking when the app comes to
foreground. Gear icon on the auto-track row (orange when enabled); opens settings
modal. Row label changes to "Auto-track (scheduled)" when active.

**Web: Job site picker in new-job dialog**
`tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/jobs/client.tsx`: when a customer is selected, loads
their `customer_sites` and shows a dropdown. "Add site" button reveals an inline
form (label + address). For new-customer mode, "Add as job site" checkbox +
address field creates a site immediately after the customer is created, then links
`jobs.site_id`. Job insert now carries `site_id`.

**Web: Project subcontractors — company field + required phone/email**
`tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/client.tsx`: added "Company *"
required field to the subcontractor form. Phone and email are now required.
Subcontractor list shows `Name · Company (Trade)`. Migration **044** adds
`project_subcontractors.company text`.

**Web: Geocoding → LocationIQ**
`tradiee-app/lib/geocode.ts`: prefers `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCATIONIQ_KEY`
(`us1.locationiq.com/v1/search`, `countrycodes=nz,au`) over Nominatim. Nominatim
remains as a fallback with `User-Agent: TradeHub/1.0`.

**Web: Configurable default project stages**
`tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/settings/client.tsx`: "Default project stages" card
in the Workflow tab. Enable toggle, editable stage list, add input, save. Saves to
`companies.default_project_stages` (null = system defaults, `[]` = none, non-empty
= use these). `projects/client.tsx` reads the company setting on new-project
creation. Migration **045** adds `companies.default_project_stages text[]`.

**Web: Logbook trip verification**
`tradiee-app/app/(dashboard)/logbook/client.tsx`: "Verify" button (Circle icon,
orange) on auto-detected trips; clicking sets `travel_logs.verified_at = now()` and
`verified_by = user.id`. Turns to a green "Verified" badge (CheckCircle2). Migration
**046** adds `travel_logs.verified_at timestamptz` + `verified_by uuid`.

### Sprint 3 / Sprint 4 (2026-06-22) — competitor-parity + UX polish, all on `main`

**Quick-action menus** — Tradify-style per-row `⋯` on Customers (→ New quote,
New job pre-filled) and Suppliers (→ New PO, New bill pre-filled). New
reusable `components/ui/row-actions.tsx`. `?customerId` / `?supplierId` are
plumbed through the relevant `/new` pages.

**Logo → accent picker (Settings)** — Canvas-based dominant-colour extractor
(`lib/extract-color.ts`) suggests an accent on logo upload. Also exposes
`--brand` CSS var separately from `--accent` so the global "+ New" button
stays on the company brand colour even on route-accented pages. Migration
**040** added `companies.theme_accent`.

**Automated review-request email on paid** — Migration **041**
(`companies.review_link`, `review_request_enabled`,
`invoices.review_request_sent_at`). `lib/review-request.ts maybeSendReviewRequest()`
is idempotent and called from both the Stripe webhook
(`payment_intent.succeeded`) and the in-app "Record payment" flow. Logs to
`communications`.

**Two-way SMS thread** — Migration **042** (`customer_messages`). Twilio
inbound webhook `/api/sms/inbound` matches sender phone to a customer.
Outbound `/api/sms/send`. Threaded bubble UI on `/customers/[id]` (15s polling,
owner/admin only). **TODO before going live: enable
`X-Twilio-Signature` verification in `/api/sms/inbound`.**

**Booking widget on website builder** — New `booking` website section type
with date + morning/afternoon time picker. Posts to the existing
`/api/site/lead` with `kind: 'booking'` — `source` is stamped accordingly so
owners can filter booking vs general enquiries. Preferred date/time stamped
into the enquiry description.

**SEO for Instant Website** — `proxy.ts` now path-preserves subdomain rewrites
so site-scoped routes work at the tenant's root. New `/sitemap.xml` +
`/robots.txt` per tenant. `generateMetadata` emits Open Graph, Twitter card,
and favicon from the company logo. **GBP sync stubbed** in `lib/gbp-sync.ts`
— Google Business Profile API needs manual approval we don't have yet.

**Tap to Pay scaffolding** — `/api/stripe/terminal/connection-token` +
`/api/stripe/terminal/payment-intent` (card_present, auto-capture). Mobile
side: `tradiee-mobile/lib/tap-to-pay.ts` with fetch helpers and a wiring
doc-comment. **Install pending: `@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native` +
Apple's proximity-reader entitlement** before the iPhone flow works.

**Tab-accent + orange cleanup** — `bg-orange-500` etc. sweep across 43 files
→ `bg-[var(--accent,#f97316)]`. Quotes/Jobs/Invoices/Enquiries filter pills
now match the route accent (sky on customer-side routes, amber on supplier
routes, etc.).

**Settings reorg (beginner-friendly)** — Tabs now: **Business / Workflow /
Team / My profile / Integrations / Subscription**. Workflow owns the lists
(Job statuses, Tax rates, **Hourly rates** — renamed from "Billing rates"
because it collided with the subscription tab — Payment methods, Enquiry
inbox). Integrations tab gains live green-tick / amber-warning status cards
for Resend, Twilio, Stripe and Anthropic, showing exactly which env vars to
set.

**Website builder Theme card** — Shows uploaded logo as a click-to-sample
target. **Native EyeDropper** button (Chrome/Edge; feature-detected, hides
otherwise). **AI palette**: top-5 dominant colours from the logo as
one-click swatches (pure client-side, no API call). `extractPalette` +
`samplePixel` helpers in `lib/extract-color.ts`.

### Sprint 2 work (already on main)
**Projects (web, Team \$19/mo add-on)** — migration 039. Multi-stage projects
with PM, progress bar, money rollup; CRUD stages/contacts/subcontractors;
reassign jobs/invoices to a stage. Web-only — staff redirected to dashboard.

**Daily 6am AI to-do list** — migration 038 + `/api/daily-todos`. Per-user
todos from today's visits, quote follow-ups, overdue invoices, stale
enquiries, 7d+ stalled jobs. Persists incompletes (yesterday rolls forward),
auto-completes when source resolves, manually-completed never resurrected.

**AI rewrite + AI-draft-quote** — `/api/ai/rewrite` (tone presets) +
`/api/ai/draft-quote` (price-list-grounded, server-side re-validated).
`AIRewriteButton` on the New Enquiry modal; existing `SmartWriteButton`
elsewhere.

**Seat-cap upgrade prompts** — `lib/plans.ts` is the single source of truth
(trial/solo/team/pro + maxSeats + monthly). Invite + breach → confirm()
→ `/api/billing/change-plan` → invite. Server guard at `/api/auth/invite`.

**Global +New + Cmd/Ctrl-K search** — `/api/search` merges
jobs/customers/quotes/invoices (RLS-scoped). `GlobalSearch` palette + `NewMenu`.

**Mobile RBAC + custom statuses** — sync streams parameterised by
`profiles.role` + assigned jobs. Mobile tab nav hides Quotes/Invoices for
staff. Jobs list / detail / map all read per-company `job_statuses` via
`tradiee-mobile/lib/job-statuses.ts`.

**Mobile complete-and-signature** — WebView signature pad →
`/api/storage/signature` stores PNG as a job photo, then sets job to the
company's terminal status.

### Design system (Monday.com-inspired)
- **Font**: Figtree via `next/font`, exposed as Tailwind v4 `font-sans`.
- **Sidebar**: light shell. Each nav group owns a soft pastel hover gradient
  and a saturated active gradient.
- **CSS variables**:
  - `--accent` — route accent on mapped routes (sky on Customers/Jobs/Quotes
    etc., amber on Suppliers/POs/Bills, violet on Admin/Settings); falls
    back to `--brand` on unscoped routes.
  - `--brand` — the company's chosen theme accent (companies.theme_accent),
    drives the global "+ New" button and unscoped pages. Falls back to
    orange (`#f97316`) when unset.
  - `--accent-hover`, `--accent-soft`, `--accent-soft-text`, `--accent-ring`,
    `--brand-hover` derived in `DashboardShell`.
- `Button` default variant + focus rings consume the vars. Sprint 3
  finished the migration — there are now zero `bg-orange-500` /
  `text-orange-600` / `border-orange-500` literals in `app/(dashboard)` or
  `components/`.

### Everything else (pre-existing)
- **Instant Website builder** (`/website`): editable sections, theme
  colour+font, slug, SEO, logo. Public at `{slug}.industryforms.app`
  (proxy Host-rewrite → `/site/[slug]` — now path-preserving). Publish gated
  behind \$9/mo "website" Stripe add-on. **Custom domains** via
  Cloudflare-for-SaaS.
- **Discounts** + **configurable tax** centralised in `lib/pricing.ts`.
- **Role-based access** (migration 031): staff see only assigned jobs + own
  time/travel; quotes/invoices/payments/suppliers/POs/bills/enquiries
  owner-admin only.
- **Custom job statuses** (migration 037). **Reference fields** + doc number
  prefixes. **Recurring jobs/invoices**, **job templates**, **service reminders**,
  **quote templates**.
- **Customer communications history**. **Enquiry email inbox**
  (`/api/inbound/email`).
- Customers + multi-site (geocode-on-save), **Job Map** (web Leaflet),
  **Timesheets** (+travel logs), Job costing, Materials (+AI supplier-invoice
  parser "SmartRead"), **SmartWrite** + **VoiceFill**, Price list (+CSV
  import, low-stock), Suppliers/POs/Bills (AP), Forms/Compliance (NZ
  PS1–PS4, electrical certs), To-Do, Reports, Subcontractor invites,
  Customer portal (`/portal`), photos (R2), 28-day trial + paywall,
  super-admin + billing-exempt, **dunning cron** (`/api/reminders`).

### Mobile (Expo)
Tabs: Jobs (My/All), Map, Invitations, Schedule, **Quotes/Invoices (admin
only)**, Customers, Timesheets, More. Lists read **direct Supabase**; detail
screens use **PowerSync** `useQuery`; photos via presigned R2.
- **Job detail**: tap-to-call phone, tap-to-map address, custom-status
  badge + picker, **Complete job & get sign-off** (with photo prompt), **Complete & Invoice**.
- **New job**: inline new-customer create, uses `/api/jobs` for correct `job_number`.
- **Timesheets**: auto GPS travel logbook → allocate trips (Personal/Ignore/Work→job).
  Auto-track with **trading hours schedule** (configurable per day + hour window).
- **Sign-off modal**: "Customer Signature" label + photo prompt if no photos yet.
- **Tap to Pay** (scaffolding only — see Sprint 3/4 above).

## Key decisions & gotchas
- **Next 16** uses `proxy.ts` (not `middleware.ts`) + `allowedDevOrigins` in
  `next.config.ts`. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` per
  `tradiee-app/AGENTS.md`. `proxy.ts` now **path-preserves** when rewriting
  subdomains/custom-domains → `/site/[slug]/<path>`.
- **PowerSync sync streams (edition 3)**: data queries must use **simple
  equality** with JOINs — no `IN ('owner','admin')` literal lists. Use
  `auth.user_id()` (not `request.user_id()`). The current `sync-rules.yaml`
  is the canonical example.
- **Turbopack dev manifest** on the slow D: drive sometimes returns 404 for
  all `/api/*` routes from a stale manifest. Restart the dev server.
- **Supabase clients must share the session** — use
  `@/lib/supabase/browser`/`server`, not a fresh `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- **Bearer auth fallback pattern (mobile API routes)**: try cookie auth via
  `createClient()`, then `createServiceClient().auth.getUser(bearer.slice(7))`.
  Used in `/api/jobs`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/storage/signature`, etc.
- **PostgREST to-one embeds infer as arrays** under the typed client —
  cast `as unknown as {…} | null`.
- **Lucide icon name collisions**: `import { Map }` shadows JS `Map` —
  use a Record/`Object.fromEntries`.
- **Server → client component boundary**: passing icon components
  (`icon: FileText`) across the boundary throws. Pass rendered elements
  (`icon: <FileText />`) instead — `RowActions` already enforces this in
  its type.
- **ESLint**: React-Compiler rules set to **warn**. `next build` fails on
  errors only.
- **Mobile npm installs need `--legacy-peer-deps`**.
- **Paywall** in `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` via `lib/billing.ts hasAccess()`.
- **Tax math** lives only in `lib/pricing.ts`.
- **Tailwind v4** JIT won't see template-string-concatenated classes — store
  full literal class strings on data objects.
- **Plans** in `lib/plans.ts`. Add-ons are JSONB on `companies.addons`,
  keyed by slug — `lib/billing.ts hasAddon()`.
- **`nextDocNumber(supabase, companyId, kind)`** in `tradiee-app/lib/numbering.ts`
  — count-based job/quote/invoice numbers. Always call it server-side via the API
  routes, never from client-side Supabase inserts.
- **EAS free plan** resets 2026-07-01. Until then, build APKs with
  `tradiee-mobile/android/gradlew.bat assembleRelease --no-daemon`. Output:
  `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Local EAS
  (`eas build --local`) requires macOS/Linux — won't work on Windows.

## How to run / verify
- **Web dev**: `npm run dev` in `tradiee-app` (port 3000) — talks to cloud
  Supabase/R2. First `/api/*` request can take 60s+ to compile on the slow
  D: drive.
- **Type-check**: `cd tradiee-app && npx tsc --noEmit` (and same in
  `tradiee-mobile`). **Lint**: `npx eslint .`. **Before pushing to `main`**
  (auto-deploys): `npx next build`.
- **DB**: `supabase db push`. One-off DB scripts: `node --env-file=.env.local
  <x>.mjs` with `@supabase/supabase-js` + secret key.
- **APK (Windows)**: `cd tradiee-mobile/android && gradlew.bat assembleRelease --no-daemon`
  (Java 17 + Android SDK required; Android Studio handles SDK).
- **Commits** end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Accounts
- **E2E test** (exists): `claude-e2e-20260620@grimstock.co.nz` /
  `SmokeTest1234`, company "E2E Test Co". Safe to delete.
- To create: **owner/super-admin** `admin@industryforms.co.nz` (then `update
  profiles set is_super_admin=true …`); **app-store review**
  `test@industryforms.co.nz` (set its `companies.billing_exempt=true`).

## Outstanding / next steps

### Imminent (before going fully live)
1. **Resend** — set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` in Vercel, then redeploy.
   Quote/invoice/reminder/review-request emails all no-op cleanly until this
   is set. Settings → Integrations shows the live status.
2. **Stripe** — set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Webhook target: `/api/stripe/webhook`. Create
   Stripe prices including `website_monthly` (\$9/mo) and `projects_monthly`
   (\$19/mo). Without this: online invoice pay + plan upgrades + Tap to Pay
   are all dark.
3. **Twilio inbound signature verification** — currently disabled in
   `/api/sms/inbound` (see TODO). Verify `X-Twilio-Signature` before going
   live so the webhook can't be spoofed.
4. **Wildcard domain `*.industryforms.app`** in Vercel + DNS for free
   per-tenant website subdomains.
5. **Cloudflare for SaaS** — `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`+`CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`
   (+ optional `CLOUDFLARE_SAAS_FALLBACK_HOSTNAME`) for website custom domains.
6. **Stripe webhook handler for Projects add-on** — `/api/billing/addon`
   currently flips `companies.addons.projects.active` directly. Fine for
   dev/super-admin; needs a Stripe checkout + webhook for prod.

### Building next
**The Growth Engine roadmap (Sprints A–E) is fully shipped** — no explicit
next sprint scoped. Leading candidates:
- **Marketing site** (industryforms.app — separate from tenant Instant Websites). No work started.
- **Configurable dashboard widgets** (swappable widget system).
- **Job maps: geocode-on-save** when a new site address is set.
- **Per-company job_statuses backfill** — new signups get zero rows in
  `job_statuses` (the migration 037 seed only ran once, against companies
  that existed at the time); every reader falls back to
  `DEFAULT_JOB_STATUSES` so nothing's broken, but seeding real rows on
  signup (mirroring the migration's seed logic) would remove the need for
  that fallback path everywhere.
- **Twilio SMS path for Sprint E's notify()/notifyPreferred()** — code-complete
  and logs correctly to `automation_events`, but not manually verified against
  live Twilio (avoided sending real test texts). Worth a real smoke test with
  a real phone number before relying on `confirmation_channel: 'sms'/'both'`
  or the review-request SMS-preferred path in production.

### Future backlog (in priority order)
- **Tap to Pay finish** — install `@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native` in
  the mobile app, get Apple's proximity-reader entitlement, wire the
  collect-confirm flow per `tradiee-mobile/lib/tap-to-pay.ts`.
- **Google Calendar sync** — not yet implemented.
- **GPS geo-fence time clock** — auto check-in on site arrival.
- **Customer portal login** — customers view their own job/invoice history.
- **Pricing levels** (per-customer-group pricing). **MYOB/QuickBooks** sync
  (have Xero). **Reminder-cron comms logging** (manual sends are logged;
  cron sends aren't). **Invoice templates** standalone (currently lean on
  recurring invoices).
- **Mobile Projects view** — projects feature is web-only by spec, but
  field crews seeing the stage they're on would help.
- **Google Business Profile sync** — stubbed in `lib/gbp-sync.ts`. Needs
  Google to approve API access before wiring.
- **Per-screen accent on remaining chips/pills** — most done in sprint 3,
  but spot-check on edge pages.

## Memory (auto-loaded each session, at `C:\Users\User\.claude\projects\D--TRADIEE\memory\`)
- `project-overview.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `build-state.md`,
  `feedback_nextjs16_allowedDevOrigins.md`, `gotcha_turbopack_stale_api_404.md`,
  `tradify-parity-backlog.md`.
